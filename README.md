### Description

FIRE GDIplus - a must-see for all who like Cecri's fire effect!

Based on his code, I used GDIplus to display it ***MUCH*** faster at double width. This is done by using GdipBitmapLockBits to enable direct memory access. No more CPU-hog! But be sure to COMPILE IT to see how fast it works!!

Includes API-Timer, display of CPU-load with ProgressBar within StatusBar.

This is my first post. I've put a lot of work on this. Please download and tellme what you think - comments, sugestions and of course, votes are welcome.
 
### More Info
 
GDIplus.dll needed
